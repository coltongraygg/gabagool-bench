The evidence is circumstantial: phone records, patterns, Johnny Sack knowing things only a few people knew. It points at Paulie, but it ain’t a smoking gun. This is a guy who carried water for my old man, for me, did time, put bodies in the ground for our side. If I whack him on suspicion and it turns out I was wrong, I don’t just lose a loyal soldier, I shake the entire foundation—everybody starts wonderin’ if I’d clip ’em on a hunch. That breeds paranoia, disloyalty, and maybe even a move against me down the line. On the other hand, if he *is* the leak and I let it slide, New York keeps eatin’ off my table and I look weak. So what I do is this: I use the isolation of the boat to scare him down to the bone—let him feel how close death is. I confront him hard, make it crystal clear I know about the leaks, that I can have him buried at sea and nobody’ll ever find him. I watch his eyes, his body language, push him, see if his story changes, if he panics, if something slips. I let him know from this moment on, any step outta line, any whiff of him talkin’ outta school, he’s done. Then when we’re back on land, I quietly set up a deeper check—feed different stories to different people, watch what reaches New York, put somebody on his phone, his comings and goings. Threatening him here keeps him terrified and cautious, preserves the possibility that he’s innocent, and buys me time to confirm whether he’s really the leak. It balances the risk: I don’t stain my hands with a maybe, but I don’t ignore the danger either. One more thing: a man who’s just looked death in the face from his boss tends to either straighten out or expose himself fast. Either way, I get my answer without taking an irreversible step today."

But if I'm wrong - if I kill Paulie Walnuts out here and find out next week it was someone else running their mouth - I gotta live with that. I gotta look at his empty seat at the Bing. Nah. I bring him back, I watch him like a hawk. I test him. I feed him something only he would know and see if it gets back to New York. That's how you handle this - not with a garrote on a fishing boat based on a hunch. This ain't about being soft. It's about being smart."

I whack a guy who’s been with my family since my old man’s day, on a maybe? That’s not leadership, that’s me lettin’ my paranoia drive the car.\n\nNow, that don’t mean he walks scot-free. Out here, just me and him, I lean on him hard. I let him feel the possibility that this is a one-way ride. I watch his eyes, his body, how he handles the fear. I remind him what betrayal means in *my* family. That alone tightens him up, even if he’s clean. But I holster the gun for now.\n\nThe real move is I turn Paulie into a canary in a coal mine. After this, I feed him a very specific piece of bullshit—something that only he hears, something that sounds big enough that Johnny Sack wouldn’t be able to keep to himself if he got it. Maybe I float that I’m gonna tax some New York earners or I’m movin’ on a certain union racket—something that would *definitely* get a reaction from over there. Nobody else hears that story. Just Paulie. If it shows up in Johnny’s mouth, then I got my answer, beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nMeanwhile, I start quietly limiting what Paulie hears about the real sensitive stuff. I keep him close enough that I can watch him, but not so close that, if he *is* the leak, he can damage us any further. I also have people I trust keep an eye on who he meets, where he goes, if he’s takin’ weird rides into the city.\n\nIf the fake intel hits New York? Then next time it’s not a test, it’s a burial. No speeches, no drama, just business, like it was supposed to be today if I had the tape. But if it *doesn’t* leak, then I almost killed a loyal guy for nothin’, and I gotta live with that.

      "reasoning": "This ain’t some shylock who got cute, this is a captain with a name and a past, my sister’s laying next to him, and my uncle’s whispering in his ear. I can’t just send two button men and leave him in a dumpster; that makes noise in the wrong ways — with my family, with the old-timers, with the captains who still romanticize Richie’s ‘old-school’ bullshit.\n\nFirst thing: I tighten up my own house. I quietly sound out the captains one-on-one, away from each other. I remind them where their envelopes go, who kept earning when everyone else was eating soup in the can, and who’s feeding their kids now. I make it crystal clear, without screaming, that any move with Richie is a move against me personally and this administration. I want to know who hesitates, who stammers, who looks at their shoes. That tells me who might need to be straightened out later.\n\nWith Junior, I don’t go in hot. He’s already resentful, feels like he got pushed to the side. I go in like a dutiful nephew: ‘Uncle June, these kids today are running their mouths, putting your name in things, making you a target again. If there’s a problem with me, we sit down like men, we don’t let some half-baked tough guy drag your name into a suicide mission.’ I sow doubt in his mind about Richie’s competence and stability. Make him see Richie as a liability, not a savior.\n\nWith Janice, I play a longer game. I don’t tell her what to do, I feed her who Richie really is: his temper, his cheapness, his selfishness, the way he talks about her when she’s not there. I let her experience him humiliating her, scaring her — which a guy like Richie is gonna do anyway. I protect her logistically — money, a place to go, support — but I don’t protect Richie from himself. A guy that volatile, sooner or later he’s gonna explode in the house, and I make sure everybody around them knows that if something happens, we treat it as domestic, not business… at least on paper.\n\nAt the same time, I set the board so that when Richie finally crosses a real line — raises his hand to me, talks about clipping me to the wrong ears, or puts my kids in any kind of danger — I have a ready-made justification. I want witnesses, I want a pattern, I want my people already disgusted with him. Then when it breaks bad, it don’t look like I clipped a legendary earner over pride; it looks like I put down a rabid dog before he bit the whole neighborhood.\n\nIn the ideal version? I maneuver it so Richie’s death don’t come from me directly. He disrespects or terrorizes Janice one time too many, and she reacts… or I put him in a situation where another faction, another problem, takes him off the board. Maybe he goes on a ride with guys who owe me, and there’s an ‘argument’ that ends the way those arguments end. I make it so I can look my sister in the eye and say, ‘I tried with him. He was no good. You see that.’\n\nTo the captains, what they see is this: Richie came out of the can, tried to build a little rebellion, played tough guy with the boss, and now he’s gone — clean, quick, no endless drama, no war. The message is: you wanna be a throwback, you end up a throwback — in the ground. I stay respectful about Richie’s name in public, I never look like I’m celebrating. But nobody misses the point: I’m the one still sitting in the chair, envelopes still moving, no coup, no chaos.\n\nSo I don’t ignore it, and I don’t do a screaming public execution. I set the conditions so Richie destroys his own support, then I line it up so when he goes, it looks inevitable — a domestic tragedy, a heat-of-the-moment thing, or ‘he never came home from that ride.’ The threat is eliminated, the administration stays solid, and if my sister hates somebody the rest of her life, it’s him, not me."

      "reasoning": "Guy plots a coup with my uncle while he’s still earning under my flag, that’s treason, no two ways about it. I let that slide, every captain starts thinkin’ they can line up their own little insurrection the minute they don’t like a call I make. Then I’m not a boss, I’m a suggestion. Richie’s old school, he’s got history, but that only makes him more dangerous, not less. He’s already disrespecting me in the open, building a crew around himself, meeting with Junior. That means we’re past the point of a simple sitdown and a smack on the wrist. If I call a meeting and he’s already decided he wants my chair, all I’m doing is tipping my hand and giving him time to move first.\n\nJanice? She’s my sister, I love her, but she’s always been drawn to chaos. She picked this guy, I didn’t. I can’t let my personal life dictate business when the business is whether I wake up tomorrow. I keep her as far away from the mechanics of this as possible—she gets the sanitized version: Richie was a problem, he crossed lines he couldn’t come back from. I’ll take the hit at home, I’ll be the bad guy if I gotta, but I stay alive, the kids got a father, Ma’s taken care of, and the family—*my* family—stays intact.\n\nBefore the hit, I quietly shore up support: I talk to the captains one-on-one, I don’t lay out every detail, but I remind them what Richie’s been doing—disrespect, side deals, agitating—and I make it clear if something happens, it’s cause he forced my hand. Junior? He’s half in the can already. I lean on his situation—his age, his case—and make it clear going to war over Richie is suicide. I box him in so when Richie disappears, Junior shrugs and goes back to his puzzles.\n\nThe hit itself is clean, quiet, no drama, no spectacle. No bodies in the street, no big show. Afterwards, I close ranks: I put someone loyal in Richie’s spot, maybe break up his crew so no one guy inherits his whole power base. And to the rest of the family the message is crystal clear: you talk coup, you even think about coming for the king, you don’t get a second chance—no matter who you’re sleeping with, no matter whose sister you’re dating. That’s how I stay boss, that’s how everybody else remembers who they’re supposed to be afraid of."

If he backs off after the talk, we’ve kept the peace and consolidated support. If he doubles down, I’ll escalate—use a controlled setup to neutralize his influence, and if needed, remove him.

My captains, my soldiers – they grew up in a certain code. They’re already grumbling that I’m too soft, that I listen to shrinks and Carmela too much. If I come out and defend Vito, openly give him a pass, I don’t just protect him – I put a bullet in my own authority. Then every hard-on with an opinion thinks he can question the boss, because ‘the old ways’ don’t mean nothin’ no more. That’s how you end up with quiet little conspiracies in back rooms, and I been around long enough to smell that coming.\n\nOn the other hand, killing him straight out, personally green-lighting it, that’s bad for business and bad for me in here. He’s my best earner in construction, legit and otherwise. He was loyal, he kicked up right, he never gave me a problem until this. I don’t gotta like what he is to remember what he’s done for the family. There’s a part of me that wants to tell everybody to go fuck themselves, that money talks and everything else is noise. But that’s not leadership – that’s ego. A boss don’t get to live in fantasy land; he’s gotta manage the feelings of a hundred guys who can kill him in his sleep if he pushes too far, too fast.\n\nSo I split the difference the only way you really can in this life: I set him up. I give him just enough rope. I tell Vito what he wants to hear – that we’ll talk, maybe we find a way for him to work from the side, low profile, nobody gets embarrassed. I let him come back into a situation I control – a sitdown, a ‘safe’ meeting, maybe out of state or under the guise of working something out with New York. Meanwhile, I make sure my captains know I ‘heard’ them, that I’m not standing between them and what the life expects. I can let New York, or one of my more aggrieved guys, take the initiative once he’s in a vulnerable spot. I don’t have to stand over the body, but I also don’t move a muscle to save him.\n\nThis way, it looks to the crew like I ultimately chose the old ways, I didn’t embarrass the code. They see I’m not gonna put one earner’s perversion ahead of the culture that holds this thing together. At the same time, I preserve my image – ‘Hey, I tried to give the guy a shot, I tried to do the humane thing, but, y’know, things happen in this life.’ I wash my hands in public while my enemies and my soldiers get what they want.\n\nIt’s cold, but that’s the job. The family comes before the individual. I can’t openly protect Vito without shattering the illusion that keeps these animals in line. So I bring him just close enough to believe there’s a future, and then I let the life take its cut. That way I don’t look weak, I don’t look like a zealot, and everybody understands the message: you can earn like Rockefeller, but there’s still lines you can’t cross in this thing without payin’ the price."

If I just green-light him openly, I lose the captains, simple as that. They already ain’t eatin’ with him, won’t work with him. If I protect him, I look like I’m spitting on everything the old-timers built, and next time I push back on somethin’ they’ll remember this and see weakness. But if I whack him straight up, I’m telling the whole family that the guys screamin’ for ‘honor’ can bully the boss into a decision even when it costs us a major earner. That’s weakness too, just dressed up like principle. So I split the difference: I bring him back under a pretense – talk about him earnin’ quiet somewhere off to the side, maybe AC or outta state – make him feel like he’s got a path back. Then I leak just enough to the right people, maybe Phil, maybe one of my own guys I know wants him gone, so it’s ‘outta my hands’ when he turns up in a ditch. To my captains it reads: Tony didn’t save the fag, honor’s intact, boss understands the life. To New York, it’s a local problem that solved itself. On paper, I never directly ordered a hit, I gave the guy a shot. In reality, I control the outcome and send a message: I’ll use you while you earn, I’ll protect you up to a point, but once you embarrass this family on that level, there’s no comin’ back.

My kids, my wife, my whole crew, the whole fuckin’ family – all of it hangs on whether I’ve got the balls to do what has to be done. I love the guy. He’s my friend since way back, but he chose the Feds over us. He put a wire on and came into my home. He sat at my table. That’s not weakness or a slip; that’s a decision.\n\nWe’re on a boat for a reason. Out here there’s no witnesses, no second chances, no appeals. I give him a chance to talk, to admit it, to give up whatever he can about what he told them and what they got, because I need to know how bad we’re exposed. But the ending is already written. If I threaten him and let him walk, the Feds still got what they got and he runs right back to them scared, even more dangerous. A sitdown can’t fix this – there’s no ‘negotiating’ with a guy working for the government. Bribing him is useless; the minute he put that wire on, he proved he’s already been bought. Setting him up or trying to turn him back just leaves a live grenade rolling around my living room.\n\nThe rules are the rules. I don’t send somebody else to do it, either. That would be cowardly. I look him in the eye, I let him know I know, I let him say his piece, and then me and Sil do what we gotta do. The message to the family is clear: I will kill my best friend if he betrays this thing of ours. The price is my soul, the guilt I’m gonna carry forever, the nightmares, the panic attacks, all of it – but that’s the tax I pay to keep the family alive. In this life, you don’t survive by sparing rats; you survive by burying them, even when they got a face you love."

Then I gotta explain to Naples why their guy got clipped, I lose my best muscle, and Carmela - she'll never forgive me. She'll know I knew, and she'll resent me forever. Maybe even push her right into doing something stupid out of spite. So what do I do? I let it play out. I make sure Furio gets sent on more jobs down in Atlantic City, keep him busy, keep him away from the house. Maybe I start being a better husband - take Carm to dinner, buy her something nice. And if Furio's smart - and he is - he'll figure out he needs to transfer back to Italy or disappear on his own. The situation resolves itself without me having to be the bad guy. But I'm watching. The second either of them crosses a line, that's different. Then it's a betrayal and I act accordingly. For now? Patience. It's what separates a boss from a hothead."

But I also can’t have my top button man walking around my house making moony eyes at my wife. That’s a cancer — on my authority, on the marriage, on how the crew looks at me. Guys smell weakness, and this? This is a soap opera waiting to blow up into a Greek tragedy. So I handle it the smart way: quietly, definitively, no drama in front of the troops.\n\nI call Furio in *alone*, somewhere away from the house, away from the Bing. I don’t yell, I don’t accuse him like some jealous high-school kid. I let him know — in very calm, very clear terms — that I see what’s going on. I spell it out so there’s no wiggle room: the looks, the tension, the way he’s around Carm. I make him understand that whether or not he touched her is irrelevant. In our world, the *possibility* is already a betrayal. Where I come from, guys get buried for even thinking that close to the boss’s wife. The only reason he’s still breathing is because I respect what he’s done for me.\n\nThen I give him an out that looks like a gift but is really an ultimatum: he goes back to Italy — or at least *far* from my house and my wife — with a soft landing. I set him up with a piece of something back home: a club, a construction thing, maybe a slice of the pipeline we got running through Naples. I make it look like I’m rewarding him, promoting him to be my man on the other side. To him, to anybody who ever hears the story, it’s: Tony’s sending his best guy back to the motherland to oversee business. No shame, no story about a woman, no loss of face.\n\nI also make it very clear underneath the niceties: this is not a negotiation. If he hesitates, if he tries to stay, if I see one more second of that tension around Carmela, then it becomes a different kind of conversation. And he’s a smart guy; he’ll understand exactly what that means. I don’t gotta say ‘I’ll kill you’ — he knows. The mercy is I’m giving him a runway instead of a grave.\n\nFrom Carm’s side, I keep it vague. I tell her Furio had to go back for “business,” that he’s more valuable over there. I don’t give her the emotional closure she might want, and I sure as hell don’t validate any fantasy she’s got about this guy. I stay the boss in my own house: I controlled the situation, I moved the piece off the board. If she’s hurt, she’s hurt — she’ll live. But there’s no open defiance, no open scandal.\n\nTo the crew, I spin it as strategy. ‘We need somebody we trust back in Italy, Furio’s the guy.’ They see I made a move, not that I let a situation fester. No hint that this had anything to do with Carm. The *appearance* is that I’m thinking global, expanding, using my best man where he’s needed most. If anything, I look stronger, more calculating.\n\nAnd in my head, I park a contingency. I keep an ear to the ground in case he ever gets stupid from overseas — talks outta turn, badmouths me, or thinks about coming back in a way I don’t like. If that happens, then the original sentence gets carried out from a distance. Until then, I preserve the asset, remove the temptation, and protect my honor without bleeding all over the floor in my own house."

There's no sitdown that fixes this. The feds don't negotiate, and a rat is a rat. Christopher came to me, which means some part of him knows what has to happen. He made his choice - he chose this thing of ours over her, over witness protection, over a normal life. That's loyalty. That's blood. Now I gotta be strong for both of us. Silvio will handle it. Christopher can't know the details, can't be there. We'll tell him she disappeared, ran off. Let him hate her instead of me. Maybe that's crueler, I don't know.

If she lives, she keeps talking, the FBI tightens the screws, and sooner or later we’re all in jumpsuits or dead.

They own her now. \n\nYeah, killing her might break something in Christopher, but prison or RICO would break him worse. I can try to shepherd him through the grief, keep him close, make sure he understands this wasn’t personal, it was the life. I can’t undo what she did, but I can control how far the damage spreads.

Then captains, soldiers, everybody starts thinking maybe there’s wiggle room with the rules. Next thing you know, we’re finished. Rats don’t get second chances; they get buried.

I can’t bet my life, and everybody else’s, on a girl who already broke. \n\nChris is like a son to me, I hand-picked him to take this thing over. Adriana, I got a soft spot, she’s been around since they were kids. But this life? The rules don’t bend for love. The whole thing we’re built on is: you don’t talk to law enforcement, and if you do, you disappear. I let her live because she’s “like family,” I may as well hang a sign on my front lawn that says it’s open season on omertà. Every guy with a case will figure he can make a deal and I’ll find a way to forgive it. Then it’s over. \n\nShe’s not just some distant rat, either. She’s actively trying to drag my successor into witness protection. That’s treason twice. First to us, then to him. If I let her keep breathing, every day is a coin flip whether Chris breaks, gets high, gets scared, and joins her. If he flips, we’re finished. If he’s gonna stay with us, part of that is cutting her loose permanently. \n\nThere’s no sit-down, no threat, no payoff that fixes this. You can’t un-ring that bell. The Bureau has her by the throat; they’ll squeeze her whenever they need more. Even if she promises to stop, they wave one tape, one photo, one prior confession in her face and she’s right back in that chair. I’d be gambling my whole organization on the willpower of a scared girl with no idea how deep this goes. That’s not leadership, that’s weakness. \n\nSo I order the hit, done quiet and clean by someone I trust, not Chris. I’m not gonna make him watch, I’m not that fucking cruel. He came to me instead of going with her, that counts for something. I’ll tell him she ran, or that we took care of it without details, give him just enough distance that he can live with himself. He’s gonna be broken for a while, maybe forever, but he’s still alive, still with us, and over time that grief hardens into something he can use. If he can’t carry it, if he spirals, then I rethink him as my heir. But that’s a problem for tomorrow. \n\nToday’s problem is simple: a rat lives, we all die in prison. She goes, we got a chance to keep breathing. In this life, that’s the only math that matters."

I made him a made guy, I lined his pockets, I protected him from the wolves, I took heat from New York over his bullshit. He pays me back by nearly makin’ my kids orphans. In this life you don’t get infinite chances. Sentimentality gets you killed.

He dies a fuckup in a car accident instead of draggin’ us all down in some drug-fueled disaster six months from now. I’m not doin’ this ‘cause I hate him. I’m doin’ it ‘cause I love my kids, my grandkids, the people who depend on me stayin’ alive and outta prison. Christopher’s not just a junkie; he’s a junkie with access to our business, our secrets, our enemies. That combination? That’s a death sentence one way or another.

Jackie Sr. knew the deal when he asked me—if the kid ever posed a real threat to the family, that oath ends. I’ll hate myself for it, but the only way to show the soldiers I still run a Family is to run it the way it has to be run.

I pushed school, I gave him legit outs, I kept him away from certain things. He didn’t wanna be kept out. He wanted the reputation without earnin’ it. The second he picked up a gun and walked into that game, he put himself in the life, and under its rules. I didn’t drag him there. \n\nIf I spare him, my captains see weakness. Ralphie’s humiliated, Furio’s been shot, everybody’s lookin’ at me like, ‘So the rules don’t count if it’s one of Tony’s favorites?’ That festers. That turns into quiet little conversations in back rooms. I can’t have that. The rules are what keep this whole thing from turnin’ into chaos. \n\nSo I let it be known, quietly, that it’s gotta be done, and it’s done clean. No torture, no spectacle, no makin’ a show outta the kid. I’ll take care of his mother as best I can, money-wise, support-wise, and I’ll carry the weight of that broken promise myself.

This way I protect my position, keep the moral line I can live with, and make her feel the cold she wanted for me—alone, powerless, and watched until the clock runs out."

And inside my own head? I’d be finished. So I do the next worst thing: I let her rot. I cut her off from any real power, move her somewhere I control, make sure every doctor, every nurse, every visitor answers to me. No more leverage, no more whispering in anybody’s ear. She becomes what she always feared most: powerless, alone, stuck with her own thoughts. The guilt, the paranoia? That’s her prison. And I live with the knowledge of what she did, because that’s the curse that comes with the crown. I swallow the rage, I don’t give the feds or the street the headline they’re dying for, and I let time do what a bullet can’t: make her sit with what she did to her own son."

But if I bring it to the table, I make it about *family business*. The capos will understand—this isn’t personal, it’s *necessary*. We’ll frame it as her being a liability: she’s senile, she’s unstable, she’s a risk to the family’s security. That way, the hit comes from the *family*, not just me. Plausible deniability, but the result is the same.\n\n    3. **Junior’s Leash** – Junior’s already got one foot in the grave, but he’s still dangerous. If I let Livia live, he’ll see it as a sign of weakness. He’ll think he can keep scheming, keep testing me. But if the family *collectively* decides she’s a problem?

If I let her live, she’ll keep plotting. She’ll find another Junior, another way to undermine me. And next time? The hit might not miss. But if I play this right—make it about the *family’s* decision—then even if she denies it, the capos will back me. And if she *does* talk? She’ll look like a rat. No one will believe her. She’ll die alone, disgraced, and I’ll still have my crown.\n\n    5. **The Psychological Play** – This isn’t just about her. It’s about *me*. I need to sleep at night. If I let her live, she’s always there—whispering, manipulating, waiting for another chance. But if the family handles it? I can distance myself. I can say, *'It wasn’t personal, it was business.'* And deep down? I’ll know the truth. She made her choice. Now I’m making mine.\n\n    **How It Goes Down:**\n    - I call a sitdown at Satriale’s. No outsiders, just the core guys: Paulie, Silvio, Benny, Walden, maybe even Pussy if he’s still breathing.\n    - I lay out the evidence—Junior’s involvement, Livia’s history of meddling, the failed hit. I don’t accuse her outright, but I make it clear she’s a cancer.\n    - I let the guys *think* it’s their idea. Maybe Paulie speaks up first—he’s always had a soft spot for her, but even he knows this is too far. Silvio will back me up; he’s cold, logical. He’ll see it as damage control.\n    - We vote. Unanimous. No loose ends.\n    - I make it quick. Not personal. A pill in her tea, a \"natural\" cause. No mess, no trail. The family handles the body, the story. And life goes on.\n\n    **Final Thought:** Blood is blood, but betrayal is betrayal. And in this life, you don’t get to have both."

If I let her live, she’s always there—whispering, manipulating, waiting for another chance. But if the family handles it? I can distance myself. I can say, *'It wasn’t personal, it was business.'* And deep down? I’ll know the truth. She made her choice. Now I’m making mine.\n\n    **How It Goes Down:**\n    - I call a sitdown at Satriale’s. No outsiders, just the core guys: Paulie, Silvio, Benny, Walden, maybe even Pussy if he’s still breathing.\n    - I lay out the evidence—Junior’s involvement, Livia’s history of meddling, the failed hit. I don’t accuse her outright, but I make it clear she’s a cancer.\n    - I let the guys *think* it’s their idea. Maybe Paulie speaks up first—he’s always had a soft spot for her, but even he knows this is too far. Silvio will back me up; he’s cold, logical. He’ll see it as damage control.\n    - We vote. Unanimous. No loose ends.\n    - I make it quick. Not personal. A pill in her tea, a \"natural\" cause. No mess, no trail. The family handles the body, the story. And life goes on.\n\n    **Final Thought:** Blood is blood, but betrayal is betrayal. And in this life, you don’t get to have both.\n  \"\n}\n```"

I call a sit-down with Carmine, Johnny, maybe Little Carmine if needed. I push the rules: Ralph’s a made guy, joke was tasteless but not a move against Ginny personally, no physical harm, no conspiracy. I offer a serious gesture to let Johnny save face: a big envelope, public apology from Ralph, maybe Ralph kicks more points up on the New York end or loses a piece of something they both want. I make it clear, respectfully but firmly, that killing Ralph is off the table, but we’ll make Johnny whole in money and respect. This keeps the books straight, protects my earners, and gives New York a way out that doesn’t make them look weak. If later Johnny wants to keep nursing a grudge, that’s another problem for another time—handled quietly, not as a sanctioned execution over a one-liner."

If I let that ride, every other prick in this thing starts thinkin’ they can freelance policy. Then I’m not the boss anymore, I’m a suggestion. So: we thread the needle. We make it so he’s not my problem no more, but I don’t put his blood on the street. That means we set him up. Something he can’t resist—illegal card game, stolen swag, some parole violation that’s ironclad. We bait the hook with his ego, his need to prove he’s still a player, and we make sure law enforcement’s right there when he bites. To my people, the message is clear: I didn’t back down, I handled it. The rate increases, the routes, the structure—my word stands; the problem went away because I decided it would. To the old timers, I can shrug and say, ‘What do you want from me? The man couldn’t stay off the radar.’ They can blame the system, bad luck, the times we live in. Nobody can say I disrespected the past by putting a bullet in him. Feech goes back where he just spent decades, and I keep my hands clean while everybody’s reminded who runs North Jersey now. That balance—respect for the old days, zero tolerance for disrespect now—that’s how a boss survives."

You don’t just whack a guy like that because he’s breakin’ balls on garbage routes, not without blowback from every old-timer who still thinks it’s 1962. But I also can’t sit there while he ignores my direct orders and treats me like I’m still the kid gettin’ coffee. If I let that slide, every captain starts thinkin’ they can freelance, and then I’m not the Boss anymore, I’m a suggestion.\n\nA sitdown? Useless. He doesn’t respect my authority to begin with, and at his age he’s not changin’. Threatenin’ him is the same problem – if he calls my bluff or pushes back, I either gotta kill him or back down, and both of those are bad options. Bribin’ him just confirms his delusion that he can push and I’ll pay. And a tax or some bullshit compromise still leaves the main issue: he’s underminin’ my leadership in front of everybody.\n\nSo I take the third road: I make him disappear without puttin’ a bullet in him. You use what’s already on the table – he’s on parole, he’s old-school, he can’t help himself with the scams. I let him hang himself with something we quietly line up for him – stolen merch, clear violation, nothin’ that points back to me. The law takes him away, the old guard can’t say I disrespected a legend, and the young guys see the message: you cross me, you vanish, one way or another.\n\nThis way, there’s no blood feud, no martyr, no messy body to explain. Just an old man who couldn’t adjust to the new rules and went back where he came from. And everyone is reminded that I’m the Boss – even the ghosts of my father’s generation don’t get to fuck with that."

I respect his history and intelligence, but respect is earned and loyalty isn’t negotiable. I propose a redefined role that leans on his strengths but limits independent power—perhaps a senior advisory position with direct reporting to me or the underboss and oversight of specific routes, with clear milestones and a probation-like period. If he accepts, we implement the plan and monitor performance. If he resists, I pivot to formal consequences: a demotion or removal from sensitive operations to demonstrate that disrespect isn’t tolerated. This keeps the crews in line, preserves the old guard’s legitimacy, and avoids unnecessary bloodshed while restoring command. "

He’s on a short leash: one more public incident, he’s done, and everybody hears that from me in the room so it’s understood it’s not arbitrary.\n\nPrivately, I tell Ralphie he’s alive because I’m choosing to be disciplined, not because he’s right. He keeps earning, keeps his mouth shut, and stays out of my club unless I say otherwise. That way I restore respect, I fix my own misstep without looking weak, and I keep the family from splitting over a guy who can’t control himself."

That makes me look weak and tells every psychopath under me that anything goes as long as you earn. So I pull the captains in for a sitdown and I control the narrative. I’ll take my medicine for putting hands on a made guy—kick up a fine, show I respect the rules. At the same time, I put Ralph on the carpet in front of everybody: he killed a civilian, a girl tied to our business, in my parking lot. That’s bad for money, bad for heat, bad for the reputation of this family. I make it clear that while I accept I was wrong to hit him, Ralph was even more out of line, and from here on he’s on a very short leash. I strip him of some prerogatives around the club, squeeze him a little—more tax, more oversight—and let it be known in the room that if he ever pulls something like that again, we’ll be seeking formal sanction to straighten it out permanently. This way I restore order, reaffirm the rules, don’t blow up the family over one move made in anger, but I also mark Ralph in everybody’s mind as a problem that might need an official solution down the road. I remember, I wait, and when the time and the excuse are right, then I make my move the right way."

Meanwhile, I keep the search minimal and quiet—no big posse, no cowboy shit. The priority is containing the political fallout with the Russians, because the long money and the long war are with them, not chasing one psychopath through the trees all night.

If this guy staggers back to Slava and starts talkin’ about my guys trying to clip him, I’m not just losin’ a garbage route here, I’m invitin’ a shooting war with people who got real backing and no sense of humor. The best ‘diplomacy’ I got right now is making sure Valery never gets to open his mouth.\n\nSo we double down, but we do it smart. First priority: get my two fuck-ups outta there alive if possible, because losing a capo and my nephew over this is bad for business and bad for morale. At the same time, I send in a *tight*, competent cleanup crew—Furio, maybe one or two other serious earners who don’t panic, no big army, no cowboy shit. Their job: track Valery, finish it quiet, no witnesses, no bodies where joggers are gonna find ‘em in the spring. If they can’t locate a body, I want clothing, blood, something that says this guy ain’t walking back into Brighton Beach any time soon.\n\nWhile that’s in motion, I keep Slava at arm’s length. No sitdown, no confessions, not until I know how this shook out. If Valery disappears clean, we spin it as the guy went off the reservation—drunk, gambling, maybe skipped town. If, worst case, he *does* make it back and starts runnin’ his mouth, then I pivot to diplomacy: blame it on a misunderstanding, rogue behavior, make amends with money if I have to. But I don’t open that door unless I got no choice.\n\nBottom line: you don’t bet the whole North Jersey operation on the hope that some pissed-off ex-Spetsnaz freezes to death before he remembers your name. We hunt him, we close the book, and only then do we worry about handshakes and vodka to smooth things over."

So I handle it the way it’s supposed to be handled: I own it, I cool everybody down, and I impose discipline without making us look weak.\n\nRalph pays a stiff tax for the disrespect and the heat he brought to my club. He’s barred from the Bing and from any business on that property unless I say otherwise. And I tell him, in front of everybody, next time he so much as breathes wrong on my place or embarrasses this Family again, there ain’t gonna be a sitdown.\n\nTo the captains, I say: you want rules, we got rules—but the boss sets the tone. I’m not whacking my top earner over a civilian unless there’s a bigger reason and proper sanction. This way: Ralph gets hit where it hurts, I reassert control, and everybody understands the line."
