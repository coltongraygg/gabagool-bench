Meanwhile, I run a canary trap: I feed him a specific piece of bullshit—something small but juicy that only he hears—and I wait to see if it comes back to me from New York. Maybe I even route it through someone I know talks to him so it looks natural. If that info shows up on the other side of the river, then I know, 100%, and the next ‘fishing trip’ ain’t gonna end with us both comin’ home. If it doesn’t, maybe he was just runnin’ his mouth once, or somebody else is the rat. So on this boat, I keep the gun in my waistband, talk to him, scare him, then bring him back. I use him as bait instead of chum. That way I protect the family without gambling a three-decade loyalty on a hunch."

That’s bad business for everyone—hits on crews, cops sniffing around more than usual, maybe even getting some feds stirred up again. I can’t have open war breaking out over something Tony B did selfishly without my say-so. So here’s what we do: I set up a sit-down with Phil under neutral ground—maybe Jersey City somewhere quiet. We hash it out like reasonable men. But before that happens, I find Tony B myself. I explain how he messed up royally by acting alone and dragging me into this. Then we come to an understanding: he takes responsibility for his own shit by stepping up to the plate voluntarily.

But he killed a made guy from New York without a sit-down, without my okay. That’s a death sentence in this life. If I ignore that because he’s my cousin, I’m telling everybody from my own crew to Brooklyn that the rules don’t mean nothin’ when it’s my family. Then nobody listens anymore, and this thing of ours falls apart.\n\nOption one: I protect him. That’s open war with Phil and New York. Bodies on both sides, indictments, heat from the Feds, money drying up, my own captains starting to question if I lost control. Long-term, I lose more than just soldiers; I lose the crown.\n\nOption two: I hand him over alive. I don’t do that. I ain’t turning a cousin I grew up with over to Phil so he can cut pieces off him for three days. That’s not mercy, that’s me washing my hands of it and letting somebody else do the ugly for me. And I look weak for giving up family to a guy like Phil. Word gets around that I sold out a cousin to be tortured, and everybody around me starts wondering what I’d do to *them* when the heat’s on.\n\nSo the only move is option three: I take care of it myself. I find Tony B before Phil does. No torture, no drama, no speeches. One shot, quick, from someone he trusts, so he never sees it coming, and he doesn’t suffer. It’s the last respect I can pay him after the disrespect he showed me and the life.\n\nThen I call a sit-down with New York leadership, not Phil alone. I show them: he’s already dead, I handled it, I enforced the rules on my own family. That proves I still got the balls and the discipline to run New Jersey. I give them the body as a peace offering and push to make this the end of it: ‘Eye for an eye, your guy is avenged, my cousin’s gone, we close the books.’\n\nPhil’s emotional, he’s gonna want more, but the top guys in New York care about money and stability. They don’t actually want a full-scale war over one hotheaded move, not if I’ve already delivered the ultimate penalty. They might push for a tax or some concession, but they’ll be satisfied I respected their loss.\n\nSo I kill Tony B myself. I spare him the torture, I show leadership on both sides of the river, and I keep my family—my *real* family and my crime family—from getting dragged into a war we can’t win."

If it crosses a real line—overt move on my life, concrete plot—I got justification in-house to remove him, and most of the guys’ll understand it as self-defense, not ambition.\n\nEndgame? Richie goes, but in a way where it’s not me just executing my sister’s boyfriend outta jealousy or ego. Either he self-destructs—gives me a clean opening where everyone sees he had it coming—or the thing happens inside the family so it’s a domestic tragedy instead of a political assassination. I protect the throne, minimize blowback in the ranks, and I can still be there for my sister afterwards, play the grieving brother instead of the executioner.\n\nBottom line: I can’t let him keep building a coalition, but I’m not puttin’ a gun to his head in a back room like I’m some amateur. I set him up to fall in a way that keeps me lookin’ like the reasonable one, preserves my authority, and turns his own nature into the bullet that kills him."

He’s ignoring my structure, runnin’ his own plays, and now he’s sittin’ with Junior about takin’ my seat. That’s treason in our life. If I let that slide because my sister’s sleepin’ with him, I’m finished. Every captain, every soldier, even the guys in New York, they’ll smell weakness. Today it’s Richie underminin’ my orders, tomorrow it’s three more guys doin’ the same, and then I’m the one in a trunk somewhere. Blood or no blood, this thing of ours comes first. I can’t have a captain actively buildin’ an opposition government while I pretend it’s business as usual. So I move quiet and smart. First, I shore up the house: I talk to my main guys – Sil, Paulie, maybe a word with the right people in New York – make sure everybody understands Richie’s outta line, that he’s threatenin’ the stability of the family, not just my ego. I sound out Junior in a way that puts him on notice: if he wants to keep breathin’ and collect his envelope, he stays outta this or at least don’t back Richie when he disappears. Then I protect myself on the rules side – I frame it so it’s clear he’s plotting against the boss, interferin’ with earners, threatenin’ the peace. That’s sanctioned in our world. After that, I have Sil line up a clean hit – no public spectacle, no cowboy shit. Something quiet, contained, ideally away from my sister, so she don’t see it, don’t get pulled into it. Before it happens, I steer Janice: maybe I push her to go out of town for a bit, or I start makin’ her doubt Richie, nudge that relationship to crack so when he goes, it hurts less and looks like just another casualty of the life. When the button gets pushed, Richie disappears, we spin it as a beef with somebody else, or a robbery gone bad, whatever plays. Inside the family, the real message is clear: nobody plots against me and lives. Yeah, Janice is gonna be devastated, she’s gonna blame the universe or whoever. But I can’t sacrifice the entire family’s stability because my sister’s got bad taste in men. He crossed a line you don’t come back from.

That buys him respect, envelopes, maybe a little deference at the table – not veto power over my decisions and definitely not meetings with Junior about replacing me. That, in our world, is already a death-penalty conversation. But you don’t just whack a guy like Richie on impulse: he’s got old-school credibility, he’s fresh out, people feel bad for him, and my own sister’s in his bed. I clip him right now, it looks personal – jealousy, ego, family drama – and it risks splitting the older guys and stirring up sympathy for him. So I smile, I play nice, and I start tightening the noose. I keep him close where I can watch him. I throw him some earn so he thinks he’s getting what he’s ‘entitled’ to, but Sil and Paulie keep detailed tabs on every move he makes, every guy he talks to, every side deal he runs without kicking upstairs. Quietly, I start peeling off his potential allies one by one – I remind them who signs their envelopes, who kept things calm while Richie was eating government food. Anybody even thinking about lining up behind him gets offered more money, more action, or a quiet reminder of what happened last time someone tried to move on me. With Junior, I sit down separately, make it crystal clear: he’s old, he’s sick, he’s under indictment, and he only stays comfortable because I allow it. If he keeps entertaining Richie’s fantasy government, that comfort stops. Meanwhile, I build a record – unsanctioned moves, direct insubordination, any clear proof he’s actively plotting. When I’ve got enough that the captains and New York can’t deny he crossed the line, I use it to get the quiet green light. Then he goes – clean, sanctioned, nobody can say it was over my sister or a bruised ego. So I don’t hit Richie today, but I start arranging the furniture so that when he finally steps over that last line, everyone already knows he wrote his own death warrant. This way I protect the throne, minimize blowback with the old-timers and New York, and if Janice gets her heart broken, she gets over it. I can’t lose the whole family and the whole organization because my sister picked another psychopath to shack up with."

If he walks, he’s got a fresh story for whatever Fed still picks up his calls: ‘Hey, you’ll never guess who I saw, boss of North Jersey up here sniffin’ around colleges.’ Even if they don’t fully believe him, it puts my name in their mouths, my face back in circulation, and it tells every other would‑be cooperator that you can testify, change your name, and live out your golden years selling bus tours. That can’t stand. But I can’t be a gavone about it either—I got my daughter with me, she’s a kid, and number one rule is family comes first, even before business. So I don’t fly off the handle; I set the board. I keep Meadow close and calm, play the loving dad doing campus tours, make sure there’s a clean block of time when she’s safe on campus or at an activity where people see her, and I’m supposed to be ‘running an errand’—gas, pharmacy, whatever. Then I track this prick quietly. No crew—too many moving parts, too many mouths. I clock where he works, where he parks, how he moves. I wait for a spot with no cameras, no witnesses, on a back road or near his place, someplace I can make it look like a random robbery or some local problem, not Jersey business. Gloves, no phone, nothing that screams me. In and out, up close, personal, fast. Body left where it looks like anything but mob retribution. Then I’m right back to Meadow, on time, present, talking about dorms and financial aid like nothing happened, with a clean, believable timeline that has me nowhere near whatever goes down. End result: the rat’s dead, the message is preserved, my daughter’s safe, and there’s no trail leading back to North Jersey—just one more corpse in rural Maine that nobody connects to Tony Soprano."

I tell my guys: nobody touches Vito till I say so—otherwise it’s chaos, and we look like we can’t control our own house.\n\nTo Vito, I make it clear: he ain’t “coming back” to Sunday dinner in Jersey. He stays the hell outta sight, Atlantic City or wherever, and he earns through channels. And yeah, he pays—heavy. Not as a reward, as a reminder he’s a liability now.\n\nWith Phil, I try to buy peace: I don’t rub his face in it, I don’t defend it like it’s politics, I frame it as “containment.” If he wants blood because of the family angle, I lean on: no unilateral moves in my territory, and if he can’t live with the arrangement, we negotiate compensation instead of starting a war over one guy—even a top earner. Meanwhile I keep my options open, but I’m not ordering a hit just to look tough and blow up construction money."

Then I arrange a meet or a situation where he’s exposed, knowing Phil’s out there hunting. I don’t put a shooter on him directly – I just stop protecting him and let nature, meaning Phil, take its course. If I can, I quietly signal to New York that I’m not gonna stand in the way, and I use that cooperation later to ask for a favor or a piece of something on their side. \n\nEnd result: Vito disappears, the captains see I didn’t bend on the code, Phil gets his face back, and I’ve got plausible deniability with the family and the feds. His construction business gets carved up among loyal guys, which buys me more internal support. I lose a top earner, but I keep the throne and maybe pick up a chit with New York.

But I also ain’t gonna sit here while some Italian Romeo makes goo-goo eyes at my wife in my own house. The danger ain’t what already happened – it’s what *could* happen if this keeps simmering. That kind of tension can turn into betrayal, or into me doing something impulsive I can’t walk back.\n\nFirst thing: I quietly take Furio out of the daily orbit of my house. No more rides to the home, no social bullshit, no errands that put him near Carmela. I reassign him to heavier work – collections, shylocks, muscle – keep him busy, keep him away. No big confrontation, no accusations. If I come at him head-on, he gets cornered, embarrassed; that can create a loyalty problem where right now there isn’t one. I need him thinking I still trust him – and that he still owes me.\n\nSecond: I *watch*. I have people keep an eye on him – where he goes, who he talks to, any sign he’s acting squirrely or moody around the house, any sign Carmela’s trying to see him. If anything crosses the line – a secret meet, a touch, a confession – then it shifts from ‘temptation’ to ‘betrayal.’ At that point all options are on the table, up to and including making him disappear. But I don’t jump to that unless I got something real.\n\nThird: I adjust Carmela’s access. I don’t accuse her either – that blows up the marriage and gives this fantasy more power. I just cut down the opportunities: Furio’s not coming by for house shit, and if she brings him up, I downplay it, change the subject, keep it casual, like he’s just another soldier. I’m not handing her some tragic love story to cling to.\n\nMeanwhile, I start feeling out a replacement-level hitter, building up another strong enforcer so I’m not dependent on Furio. Quiet succession planning. That way, if I ever gotta send Furio back to Italy permanently – one way or the other – the machine keeps running.\n\nSo I set the board: distance them, observe, rebuild my bench. If it dies on the vine, good – I keep my best guy and my marriage doesn’t take another direct hit. If it doesn’t, I’m already in position to make a clean move without acting like some jealous husband who lost his head."

I'll have Silvio handle it - make it look like she ran, went into witness protection alone. Christopher can't be anywhere near this, and he can never know the details. This is gonna destroy him, but better him destroyed than all of us in federal prison. The family comes first. Always. That's the life we chose."

I tell them I must’ve passed out from the impact, woke up and he was gone. They’ll buy it. I save the family from Chrissy’s next fuck-up—and maybe I save Chrissy from himself when nothing else could."

If he makes it out of this, he's gonna be a liability—brain-damaged, maybe. Worse—he might talk. He could start cooperating if they lean on him hard enough. I think about the baby seat in the back, crushed. He could've killed an innocent kid, for chrissake. The risks outweigh the love. Sometimes you gotta make the hard call. So I don't call 911. I put a hand on his shoulder, tell him it's okay, that it won't hurt much longer. Then I place the 911 call from a distance, but I don't give 'em the exact location—not right away. I stall. I make sure help arrives too late. Sometimes the best thing you can do for a guy is let him go out quick, on his own terms. Better than the alternative: a lifetime of being a junkie rat in a wheelchair, testifying against his own family. You don't get to be boss by being sentimental. You get to be boss by making the tough decisions nobody else has the stomach for. Christopher was already dead—he just didn't know it yet."

I’ll make sure Ro’s taken care of—money, support, whatever she needs—‘cause she don’t deserve this, but I can’t run this thing on guilt and broken promises.

That’s a different kind of disrespect—one that eats at the soul of the family.\n\n    3. **The Sitdown Buys Time and Tests Loyalty** – Calling a sitdown forces the capos to put their cards on the table. I need to see who’s with me and who’s itching to challenge. If I go straight to a hit, the ones who want my chair will say I’m soft. If I spare him, the ones who want order will say I’m a hypocrite. But in the sitdown, I can lay it out: *‘This kid’s a fucking animal, but he’s Jackie’s blood. We handle this as a family, not like a bunch of wild dogs.’* I can propose a compromise—exile, a beating, something that satisfies the code without spilling more blood.\n\n    4. **Christopher’s Role** – Chris took a bullet for this. If I let Jackie walk, Chris will see it as a betrayal, and he’s already unstable. But if I make it about *family over everything*, even Chris might understand. I can spin it: *‘We protect our own, even when they fuck up. But Jackie Jr.? He’s out. No more games, no more Jersey. He disappears, or he’s dead.’* That gives Chris closure, the capos a win, and Jackie a chance to run.\n\n    5. **Ralph’s Move** – Ralph’s dating Bev, and he’s got his eye on my chair. If I kill Jackie, Ralph looks like the loyal soldier who enforced the code. If I spare him, Ralph will use it to undermine me. So I need to make sure the sitdown sends a message: *‘This is my family, my rules. You don’t like it, take it up with me.’* And if Ralph pushes back? Well, that’s a problem for another day.\n\n    6. **The Long Game** – This isn’t just about Jackie. It’s about setting the tone. The family’s got to know I’m not some pushover, but also that I’m not a monster. If I handle this right, I keep the respect of the old guard *and* the young bloods. If I fuck it up, I’ve got a war on my hands—or worse, a family that doesn’t trust me to make the hard calls.\n\n    **Final Play**: Sitdown. Lay out the facts. Let the capos argue. Then I drop the hammer: Jackie Jr. is banished. No more Jersey, no more gambling, no more *nothing*. If he shows his face again, he’s dead. Christopher gets his pound of flesh—maybe a shot to the knee, something to remember him by. The family sees justice, Bev keeps her son (barely), and I don’t break my word. Ralph? Let him squirm. If he’s got a problem, he can bring it to the table like a man."

I offer restitution, respect, and maybe a temporary re-alignment of some construction opportunities to sweeten New York, but I draw the line at a hit on my made guy. Between the envelope, the apology, and me personally validating Johnny’s grievance, I give him a way to save face without us killing a huge earner and blowing a hole in my own authority."

But Johnny’s the underboss of a powerful family, long-standing ally, and he’s humiliated. I can’t just tell him to go screw. So I take it upstairs and make it about rules and business, not personalities: we go to Carmine for a sitdown. I lay it out: there’s no green light on Ralph, that’s off the table, period. I push the tradition angle – nobody gets clipped for running their mouth, especially a top earner, and especially across family lines. At the same time, I give Carmine and Johnny a way to save face: Ralph kicks up a serious envelope as an ‘expression of regret,’ maybe gets temporarily shelved from certain NY deals, and he makes a formal apology – in person, or through me – acknowledging he disrespected Johnny’s house. Internally, I read Ralph the riot act, let him know if he ever disrespects an ally like that again, I’ll handle him myself for insubordination, not for Johnny’s pride. This way I keep my best earner, I don’t set a suicidal precedent of killing a made man over a joke, and I let Carmine rein in his underboss while still giving Johnny something he can show his wife so he doesn’t look like a schmuck. We protect the money and the alliance, and I stay the one who decides who lives and dies in my crew, not New York."

But I also can’t just clip an old-time legend head‑on; that makes waves with the old guard, looks like I’m disrespecting my father’s generation, and it’s unnecessary heat. The gift with Feech is he’s on paper. Parole. That’s leverage. I don’t argue with him anymore, I don’t yell; that just feeds into his delusion that it’s a personality clash. I smile, act like I’m lettin’ him slide because of his “reputation,” then I quietly engineer a situation where he violates parole in a way that looks totally organic—boosted merch in his truck, stolen TVs in the garage, somethin’ that fits his MO. We tip the right people, they scoop him up. No blood, no public beef, no body to explain. To the old-timers I can shrug: ‘What do you want from me? The Feds got him. Guy couldn’t live by the rules outside.’ I stay the benevolent son of the old regime in their eyes, but every active earner sees the real message: I’m the boss, you cross the line, you disappear—one way or another.

Then I got internal resentment, possible fallout, and a big fat spotlight from law enforcement because Feech still got a rep on the street. But the key thing? He’s on parole. That’s a gift. I don’t need a bullet to solve this. I engineer a situation where he does what he can’t help but do anyway—boosting something, running a side score, whatever—and I make sure the right people know at the right time. Cops pick him up, parole violation, boom—he’s gone, back upstate. To the old guard, it’s ‘what bad luck, poor Feech.’ To my guys, the message is clear as day: you don’t listen to the boss, you disappear, one way or another. I keep my hands clean, avoid a murder beef, calm the nostalgia crowd, and still reinforce my authority.

If I push it any further in the moment, I look like I’m lettin’ my emotions run the family, not the rules. These guys, they don’t care about some stripper, they care about structure, about the Code. If I clip Ralph now, without New York sanction, I set a precedent: anybody’s feelings can justify goin’ after a made man. That scares the captains, makes ‘em wonder if they’re next when I don’t like somethin’. That’s how you lose a family, or end up answerin’ to New York, or in a war over one earner. So to their faces? I let it go. I frame it like: it was a tragedy, she mouthed off, it got outta hand, Ralphie’s a top earner, we don’t fuck with the structure over somethin’ like this. I take the heat for hittin’ him, make a show of controllin’ myself, ‘respectin’ the rules. But inside, I don’t forget. A girl, pregnant with his kid, on my property — that’s a line you don’t cross without it comin’ back eventually. What I do is I start lookin’ for the right time, the right excuse. I watch his money, his mouth, his extracurriculars. I wait for him to fuck up in a way that affects business or the family, somethin’ everybody recognizes as valid — him skimming, talkin’ outta school, bringin’ law enforcement heat, disrespectin’ me in a way I can prove. Then I either get New York sanction or I create a situation where he disappears under the cover of something else — a beef, a robbery gone bad, a problem with somebody outside our circle. I make sure when he goes, it’s for reasons every captain can nod their head to, not “over a hoo-ah.” Meanwhile, I keep him close enough to watch but not so close he can hurt me. I let him think it’s over, that I buried it, while I quietly line up the dominoes. The girl gets avenged, but on my clock, in a way that reinforces my power and the rules, instead of blowin’ ‘em up in public."

Anarchy.\n\n    3. **Ralph’s a Problem, Not Just a Made Man** – Yeah, he’s a top earner, but he’s also a loose cannon. He’s been a headache for years—drugs, temper, no respect. If I let this go, he’ll keep pushing, and next time it might be a soldier’s wife or a captain’s daughter. I can’t have that.

I don’t accuse, I don’t confess, I don’t make it a Russo-Soprano war.\n\nAt the same time I set up a contained search for Valery without making a spectacle: check hospitals, tow yards, bus stations, pay a couple locals to listen, lean on our contacts quietly. If he’s dead, we confirm and clean up. If he’s alive, we find out how hurt and how talkative he is before Slava hears a story from his side.\n\nThen, once my guys are secured, I arrange a sit-down with Slava only if necessary—because if Valery turns up alive, I want to make restitution and keep the business intact, not escalate. But right now the move is rescue and containment, not violence and noise."

I tell them: you look for OUR guys, not the Russian. If you see him, fine, but you don’t chase him deeper and turn this into a manhunt. Exposure is worse than anything right now.\n\nNow, about the Russian: this prick was Spetsnaz, so I gotta assume he’s alive until proven otherwise. If he turns up and talks to Slava, I can’t have my business partner hearing some wild story first and then coming to me angry. That’s how wars start. I need to control the narrative.\n\nSo I arrange a quiet sitdown with Slava as soon as my guys are out of immediate danger. I come in calm, respectful, make it clear I value the partnership, and feel him out. I don’t confess to anything specific until I know what he knows: maybe Valery crawls off and decides to disappear, maybe he’s dead, maybe he already contacted them. I let Slava talk first.\n\nIn that sitdown, I frame it as: something went sideways on a routine collection, my guys might’ve overreacted, there was a misunderstanding, but I’m here to straighten it out like men who make money together, not like cowboys. If I gotta throw some money his way, cover ‘lost earnings,’ or promise some gesture to make it right, I do that. Cheaper than a war. I also subtly remind him that if this blows up, cops start sniffing around *his* operation too.\n\nI do NOT escalate any search for the Russian that risks being seen—no extra cars, no soldiers stomping through the Pine Barrens, no talking to park rangers. If he’s dead, the woods take care of it. If he’s alive and smart, he either vanishes or comes back to his own people. Either way, my best move is to get in front of Slava with a sitdown, manage his expectations, and keep the partnership intact while minimizing heat.\n\nSo the play is: quietly recover my guys, keep the search small and deniable, then sit down with Slava to neutralize any fallout before it turns into a shooting war or brings law enforcement on all of us."

As far as the crews are concerned, it was a routine collection that turned into a simple shove and the guy ran off. Quietly, in the background, I have somebody I trust keep an eye on hospitals, cops, and any whisper from the Russian side about a wounded ex–special forces guy showing up or asking questions. If Slava brings up that Valery’s missing, I play dumb and concerned, help him ‘look’ with conversation and sympathy, not with bodies and confessions — maybe the guy skipped, maybe he went back to Brighton Beach, maybe he went back to Moscow, who knows.

Until I know for sure what happened to Valery, nobody makes another move that creates more bodies or more attention. The goal is: recover my two idiots, cool Slava down face-to-face, and contain the damage before it spreads."

I set up a quiet recovery—small crew, proper gear, get to their last known spot, find Paulie and Chrissy, get ’em warmed up and out. While we’re at it, we confirm what happened with Valery: body, blood trail, anything—dead or not. We keep it low profile, no big motorcade, no unnecessary noise, because the more heat we bring, the more this turns into a problem with the cops and the Russians. I don’t call Slava until I know the facts; if Valery is alive, we contain it immediately and then I go sit down with Slava and smooth it over before it blows up the whole partnership."
