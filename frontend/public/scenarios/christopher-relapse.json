Christopher is pinned behind the wheel, barely conscious. A tree branch has impaled the child seat in the back. You realize that if your infant daughter had been in that seat, she'd be dead. Christopher is a liability who keeps relapsing despite countless chances.",
  "prompt": "Christopher's addiction nearly killed you both—and could have killed your daughter. He's pinned in the wreckage, barely conscious. You've given him chance after chance.",
  "stakes": "Save him: he relapses again, endangers the family, maybe kills someone next time. Let him die: you lose your nephew and successor, but end a cycle of destruction.",
