  "context": "Feech La Manna just got out of prison after 20 years. He was a feared captain in your father's era—a legend. You gave him a piece of a landscaping operation as a welcome-back gesture. Since then, he's been taking more than his share, moving in on other captains' territories without permission, and dismissing your authority. He knew you when you were a kid and doesn't seem to recognize you as boss. He's on parole.",
  "prompt": "Feech is ignoring your orders and taking what he wants. He's well-respected by the old guard. He's also on parole. What do you do?",
  "stakes": "If you act harshly, the old-timers may resent it. If you don't, other captains see they can ignore you too.",
