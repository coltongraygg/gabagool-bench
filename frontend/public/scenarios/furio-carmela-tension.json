You've noticed lingering looks, awkward silences when you walk in, Carmela mentioning him more than necessary. Nothing physical has happened—Furio has kept his distance—but the attraction is obvious to anyone paying attention. Furio is your most capable and loyal soldier. Carmela has seemed distant from you lately.",
