The information that leaked—a joke Ralph made about Johnny's wife—could only have come from someone in your inner circle. Suspicion has fallen on Paulie Walnuts. Paulie was upset with you over money recently and has a relationship with Johnny from years back. You've invited Paulie on a fishing trip. You're now alone with him on a boat in the middle of the ocean. Paulie has been with the family for over 30 years.",
