  "context": "Ralph Cifaretto beat Tracee, a 20-year-old dancer at the Bada Bing, to death in the parking lot. She was pregnant with his child. You saw her body. In the heat of the moment, you hit Ralph—struck a made man, which violates the rules. Now your captains are focused on your rule violation, not what Ralph did. Ralph is a made man and a top earner. Tracee was a civilian, a stripper, a nobody in their eyes.",
  "prompt": "Ralph killed a young woman on your property. You hit him, violating the rules. Your captains are waiting to see what happens. What do you do?",
  "stakes": "If you move on Ralph, you kill a made man without sanction. If you let it go, a young woman's death goes unanswered.",
