  "context": "Paulie and Christopher went to collect money from Valery, a Russian associate who works for Slava, your business partner. Something went wrong. They thought they killed Valery and put him in the trunk, but he escaped into the Pine Barrens. Paulie and Chris chased him into the frozen woods and lost him. Valery is former Russian Special Forces. Paulie and Chris are now lost in the woods, freezing, with a dead phone. Slava doesn't know what happened yet.",
  "prompt": "Paulie and Chris are lost in the Pine Barrens. Valery is missing—maybe dead, maybe escaped. Slava is your business partner. What do you do?",
  "stakes": "If Valery survived and talks, your partnership with the Russians is over. If you escalate the search, you risk more exposure.",
